# Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics include the identification of candidateâ€™s genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Target protein search that means selecting target of one's interest say that deploying machine learning model for discovering breast cancer drugs we select aromatase as the target protein search and so on and so forth.
By using machine learning models and descriptors which resulted in sufficient data for further removal and dropping of unnecessary data. Training and testing that data with random forest regressor and conducted model comparisons for better results.
Deployment of the model on web application.
